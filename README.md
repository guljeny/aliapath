# How it works

Place cursor on the line with path and type `:OpenPath`.

Plugin understand as path any string wrapped in `'` or `"`.

> Relative (starts from `./` or `../`) and absolute (starts from `/`) paths will be open imediately.

If only one file with name (last part of path, `baz` in `foo/bar/baz`) found, this file will be opened.

If there some files with the same name (`baz.js` and `baz.css`) - you will see the file picker window.

- Use `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` to navigate up / down in this window.
- Use `Enter` to open file.

## Tips

> Still slowly? Try to create alias?

``` vimscript
map <leader>o :OpenPath<CR>
```
